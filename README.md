# Antoine Griezmann Scouting Report: What skills does he possess, and how will they translate at Barcelona?
_Brandon Dominique_

After almost two years of rumors and speculation, Atlético Madrid player Antoine Griezmann has finally transferred to FC Barcelona after paying his €120m release clause. Barcelona will be receiving a player who has shown a high degree of tactical flexibility and has already proven to be successful in La Liga, while Atletico will receive some funds that can help replenish their bank account after their massive splurge on João Félix.

At Atlético, Griezmann mainly occupied a spot as a striker in coach Diego Simeone’s beloved 4-4-2, but he was also capable of playing out wide if the situation required it. Operating mainly as a second striker, Griezmann was often tasked with being the main attacking force of his team; if Atléti were to score, Griezmann was almost certain to be involved. This is a responsibility that he carried very well: in his five seasons at Atléti, Griezmann outperformed his Expected assists in 3 of those seasons, while also outperforming his Expected Goals in every single season and averaging a Key Pass per 90 of 1.56.

Griezmann’s position has him as a striker, but in reality he had a somewhat free role in Atlético‘s setup. It wasn’t uncommon to see him drop deep to help aid in buildup or to pop up on either flank to in search of space, which allowed him to exploit the spaces that attacking-minded fullbacks would leave behind. His heatmap from the home league game against Real Madrid illustrates the picture of an attacker who isn’t bound to necessarily one part of the pitch and can drift to different areas.

Griezmann can also play off the shoulder of defenders at times, and combined with the strategic timing of his runs can lead to dangerous 1v1 chances for him:

Griezmann has also shown the ability to be the assister in this situation. Its not uncommon to see Griezmann make an intelligent pass for deep to the striker that’s playing ahead of him, whether it be Alvaro Morata, Diego Costa or Nikola Kalinić (More on this later).

One flaw in his game, however, is his tendency to disappear from games where he can’t find space. In doing the research for this report, however, I find that it’s not necessarily Griezmann’s fault but rather the fault of Atléti to hold onto the ball and generate quality offense. If Griezmann can’t find space out wide or by dropping back and Atléti’s midfield is doing a poor job of holding onto the ball, then it usually spells trouble for Atléti’s offense that day. Thankfully, Griezmann is also capable from producing good opportunities for himself and teammates from set pieces. Statistics from transfermarkt.us show that Griezmann has scored a combined 6 goals from penalties and free kicks this season, which for a team like Atléti that doesn’t score often, can be a huge boost. His set piece delivery leaves a bit to be desired though, as he holds corner delivery responsibilities for both club and country and only has one assist directly from a corner in 2018/19.

An underrated aspect of Griezmann’s game is his willingness to defend. Both France’s and Atlético’s formation morphs into a hybrid 4-4-1-1/4-5-1 when they’re without the ball, with Griezmann operating as part of the midfield 5 or as the deeper 1. While he can also play as the lone striker in defense and try to be an outlet if his team wins the ball, I think that he’s at his most effective when he drops in to defend. He is more than happy to track back in these defensive systems, and he often is effective at stopping any runs through the middle that opposing midfielders may try:

Griezmann’s defensive positioning is especially key to Atlético’s Counter-Attacking prospects. Another benefit of allowing him to drop in to defend is that is Atléti win the ball back and Griezmann is in an ideal position when this happens, he is more than capable of leading the offensive transition, whether he’s running at defenders or he’s playing a pass to the forward higher up the pitch:

Whoscored.com has Griezmann at 0.8 Tackles, 0.3 interceptions and 0.5 fouls per 90 at Atletico. This gives off the impression that Griezmann can defend when necessary but can sometimes be clumsy when doing so, which isn’t too far off from the truth.

### Summary

Griezmann is a La Liga Veteran who knows how to make not only himself but his team better as well. While it’s unclear where his spot in Barcelona will be, one can expect him to see plenty of time somewhere given that he can play both in the middle and out wide. Creative responsibilities will be taken oven by Messi, so Griezmann will likely take a backseat and be more of a finisher for the chances created for him, rather than being the sole creator and finisher like at Atlético. Defensively Griezmann should be ok, as his willingness to defend should translate over relatively well to Ernesto Valverde’s preferred defensive schemes. Overall, Barcelona fans should be excited that they finally have a player other than Messi who knows how to drag their team to victory if need be.
